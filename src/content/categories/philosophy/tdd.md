## Core Development Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **ALWAYS write tests before implementation code**
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  1. **Red**: Write a failing test first
  2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
  3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Keep tests simple, focused, and readable
